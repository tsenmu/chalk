# Chapter 1: The Psychopathology of Everyday Thing

Humans are not just confused about complex things. They get confused with everyday things such as doors. A door where the design tells you to do the opposite of what you are actually supposed to do is a Norman door. Here is one interesting video I found from the web explaining how a bad design of doors could influence our lives.

There are two important aspects characterizing good designs: **discoverability** and **understanding**. Discoverability characterizes the initial impression of a product to the user - what it does, how it works, and what operations are possible. Understanding characterizes whether one can figure out what it all means, i.e., whether the user can successfully establish a conceptual model on how the product works. The Norman doors, are a good example of what happens when a product has poor discoverability. 

All artificial things need to be designed, and this process is not trivial. It involves many factors balancing cost, manufacture, aesthetics, and ergonomics. Different design fields have different focuses. Industrial designers look at a product and optimize the function, value, and appearance of the product in order to put it into mass production. Interaction designers look at how things are ought to be, how people interact with technology, and optimize the product applying principles from psychology, design, and art. Experience designers, on the other hand, place the focus on quality of the holistic user experience.

There are many reasons that everyday things can be designed badly, but the major reason is that the lack of understanding in the design principles necessary to design machines that comply with human needs. Engineers are trained to think logically. Therefore, they design machines assuming the users also think logically. In reality, humans do not follow strictly the rules machines ought to follow. Humans are reluctant in reading pages long instructions that do not make sense. Humans make error frequently when the design is bad.

So what to do? The solution is **human-centred design**. Human-centred design is "an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behaviour first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving." It requires good communications between designers and users, especially when things go wrong. Through rapid tests of ideas, designers get to observe and understand what users truly need. Designers should iteratively improve the design to approximate the user requirements.

Good design results from the application of the following psychological concepts: **affordances**, **signifiers**, **constraints**, **mappings**, **feedback**, and most importantly, **conceptual models** of the system.
